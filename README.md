What this project does
PHP Secure Auth provides a ready-to-use authentication stack for PHP applications. It emphasizes a safety-first approach without sacrificing developer ergonomics. It includes:
- A secure login workflow with rate limiting and account protection
- CSRF protection for all forms and critical actions
- Password storage using modern hashing algorithms with pepper and salt considerations
- Safe session handling and secure cookies
- A responsive, accessible UI built with Tailwind CSS
- A data access layer based on PDO to prevent SQL injection
- Clear separation between UI, business logic, and data access

How it works in practice
- Users access a login page that presents a minimal, accessible form. The form uses a CSRF token that is generated server-side and validated on submission.
- If the credentials are correct, a session is created with a strong session ID, and a secure cookie is set. The user is redirected to a protected area.
- If the credentials are incorrect, the system increments a per-user or per-network IP attempt counter and triggers a cooldown or temporary lockout after a configurable threshold.
- All sensitive actions (like password reset or account updates) require CSRF validation and proper permission checks.
- The system uses prepared statements to guard against SQL injection and hashes passwords with a strong algorithm (e.g., password_hash with PASSWORD_BCRYPT or PASSWORD_ARGON2I, depending on PHP version and environment).
- The UI is responsive and accessible, with clear focus styles and high-contrast modes.

Core design and architecture
- Separation of concerns: The codebase separates routing, business logic, data access, and presentation. This reduces coupling and improves testability.
- Database access layer: A thin PDO wrapper enforces prepared statements, parameter binding, and error handling. This provides a consistent path for queries and helps prevent injection vulnerabilities.
- Security-first defaults: CSRF tokens, anti-replay protections, secure cookies, and strict session handling are built in and configurable.
- Extensible UI: The frontend uses Tailwind CSS for rapid styling and theming. It is designed to be replaced or extended without touching core authentication logic.
- Local testing and portability: The code is written to be portable across common PHP stacks and can be tested locally with minimal setup.

Security and threat model
- CSRF protection: Every non-idempotent action is guarded by a CSRF token. Token validation happens on the server side before any state-changing operation is performed.
- Brute-force mitigation: Login attempts are tracked per user and IP, with adaptive cooldowns. After a configurable number of failed attempts, further attempts are throttled or temporarily blocked.
- Password management: Passwords are stored using strong hashing algorithms with automatic rehashing when the library detects a better algorithm. Password resets require verification and time-bound tokens.
- SQL injection prevention: All queries use prepared statements. Input is validated and sanitized, with strong typing where possible.
- Session security: Sessions are tied to server-side storage when available, with secure cookies, HTTP-only flags, and strict session lifetimes. Session regeneration happens on privilege changes.
- XSS protection: Output escaping is applied where data is displayed, and content security policies are considered for inline scripts and resources.
- Access control: Roles and permissions are defined to control who can access certain routes. Sensitive actions require appropriate permissions.

Database schema and migrations
- Core tables typically include:
  - users: stores user_id, username, email, password_hash, created_at, last_login, status
  - login_attempts: stores attempt_id, ip_address, user_id (nullable), attempt_time, success
  - sessions: stores session_id, user_id, last_activity, ip_address, user_agent
  - reset_tokens: stores token, user_id, expires_at, used
  - roles and user_roles: optional for advanced access control
- Migrations come with a versioned history. They can be executed via a migration tool or a simple SQL script depending on the deployment approach.
- Example workflow: Create the database, run the migrations, seed with an initial admin user, and configure application settings.

FAQ and troubleshooting
- How do I enable CSRF protection?
  - CSRF tokens are generated per session and embedded in forms. Submissions must include the token, and the server validates it before any state-changing action is performed.
- How does brute-force protection work?
  - The system tracks failed login attempts from users and IP addresses, then applies cooldowns after a configurable threshold.
- How should I handle password resets?
  - Password reset uses time-limited tokens sent via email. The token is validated before allowing a password change.
- What about SQL injection prevention?
  - Every query uses prepared statements with bound parameters to keep data separation clean and safe.
- How can I customize the UI theme?
  - Tailwind CSS is used for styling. You can adjust the palette, typography, and spacing through the Tailwind configuration.
